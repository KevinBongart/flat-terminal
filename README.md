flat-terminal
=============

Flat design colours applied to terminal. Terminal is now sweeter than ever!

This fork of Ahmet SÃ¼lek' original [flat-terminal](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal) theme uses white as a main text color and red as cursor and selection color.

Pairs well with the [gitsome theme](https://github.com/KevinBongart/gitsome) for oh-my-zsh.
